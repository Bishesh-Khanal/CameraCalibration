# CameraCalibration

I solved the basic camera calibration task by implementing the industry-standard checkerboard pattern method using OpenCV (through extensive documentations and youtube tutorials) to calculate essential calibration parameters (camera matrix and distortion coefficients). I addressed the user guidance requirement through clear console feedback showing which images successfully detected corners, visual display of detected corners, and progress tracking throughout the process. I thoroughly covered the validation aspect with reprojection error calculation to assess calibration quality, error handling for unreadable images, and a practical demonstration showing the undistorted result. The tool outputs all calibration parameters to a saved file (calibration_data.npz) for future use, includes sub-pixel corner refinement for accuracy, and provides robust image processing with adaptive thresholding to handle varying lighting conditions: creating a complete, production-ready calibration solution that exceeds the basic requirements by including quality metrics and practical usability features.
